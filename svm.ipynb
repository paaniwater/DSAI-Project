    "## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin between the closest data points from each class, also known as the support vectors. This margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. "
